Elements in Pong that could be broken up into their own methods

My initial ideas:
Board with divider
Ball movement
Score keeping (part of paddle/player instance)
Score display
Paddle movement

Her breakdown:
Create the screen  600x800
Create and move a paddle
Create another paddle
Create the ball and make it move
Detect collision with wall and bounce
Detect collision with paddle
Detect when paddle misses
Keep score
